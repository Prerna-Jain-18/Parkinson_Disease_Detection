### Parkinson's Disease Detection

This project focuses on detecting Parkinson's disease using machine learning models based on patient data and medical records. It aims to predict the presence of Parkinson's disease based on various features and symptoms.

## Features

- **Dataset:** Uses a dataset containing patient characteristics, symptoms, and diagnostic information.
- **Preprocessing:** Applies data preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
- **Classification:** Implements machine learning classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks) to predict Parkinson's disease.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluates the model performance using metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC-AUC score.

## Technologies Used

- **Python Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code
- **Dataset:** Provide details on the dataset used (source, size, attributes).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/parkinsons-disease-detection.git
   cd parkinsons-disease-detection
